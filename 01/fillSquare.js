const fillSquare = (arr) => {
    
};

module.exports = { fillSquare };

/*
The function fillSquare should take an array of arrays and should complete 
these arrays so that they are a square matrix with the value null standing 
in for any blank positions. If extra sub-arrays are needed to complete the 
square, these should be added at the bottom of the matrix.

Example
Here, to complete a 3 * 3 square we need to fill up the last two sub arrays 
with null.

const square = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1]]

fillSquare(square)

  [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 2, null],
    [1, null, null]
  ]
